Openhaus creates 3-dimensional digital twins of the property under construction, to enable a full-stack visual understanding of the development. The launch of the application will open up huge opportunities for homebuyers by providing a safe and secure way of viewing property in the post pandemic era, eliminating the need for multiple site visits by enabling faster and more informed decision-making. This will change the landscape of the real estate market in the country by introducing a never seen before, one of its kind technology.

This 3D technology for the real estate industry provides gamified and immersive tours of properties with detailed elevations and isometric dollhouse views. It provides the ability to walk through each and every unit enabling prospective home-buyers and tenants with an accurate and immersive experience of their future home even before it is even built. Prescon Group & Openhaus Technologies have come together to provide the next generation property purchase experience at their sales gallery in Mahim. For Homebuyers, this will eliminate the need to be present at a site physically, overall time and cost savings in complete product understanding, which will in turn enable faster and confident decision making. The benefits provided by the software will remain relevant in the post pandemic era.
