**My Role :** _Core Developer_ 

**Tech Stack :** _C++,Unreal Blueprints,Nodejs_ 

**Platform :** _CloudStreaming(Hosted on AWS GPU instances),Windows_

**Project Description :**

Openhaus offers an end-to-end solution â€“ from understanding the location, building elevation, amenities, typical floor layouts, and each and every unit mapped with its real views.  Openhaus creates 3-dimensional digital twins of the property under construction, to enable a full-stack visual understanding of the development. The launch of the application will open up huge opportunities for homebuyers by providing a safe and secure way of viewing property in the post pandemic era, eliminating the need for multiple site visits by enabling faster and more informed decision-making. This will change the landscape of the real estate market in the country by introducing a never seen before, one of its kind technology.

Openhaus leverages **_Unreal Engine 4_** combined with **_Nvidia RTX_** for it's photo-realistic visuals which comes at a cost of high-end graphics hardware.We also use Cloud-Streaming to provide the content to client devices so that the end-user doesn't have to worry about hardware requirements.
