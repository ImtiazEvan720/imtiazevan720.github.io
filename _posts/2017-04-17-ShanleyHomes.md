Render Vision Europe AB has developed this app as a marketing platform for the housing project Bacchus, - a new district in Falkenberg, Sweden.

Use our app to find your new home and get ocean view for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

Our app uses 3D and AR – Augmented Reality - to let you walk in the area, look inside the apartments and enjoy the views. See the film that shows the unique pier where Bacchus is situated and get a feeling of architecture and the insides of the apartments.
